    const questions = [
        {
            question: "1. Lebron obtained a loan of Php 350,000 secured by a Real Estate Mortgage on his lot in Quezon City, which has an assessed value of Php 500,000. If the bank files an action for judicial foreclosure, what is the proper court and venue?",
            options: [
                "Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, as the loan amount is below Php 400,000.",
                "Regional Trial Court of Makati City, as it is a personal action to collect a debt.",
                "Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, because judicial foreclosure is a real action and the assessed value exceeds Php 50,000.",
                "Metropolitan Trial Court of Makati City, where the plaintiff resides."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: An action for judicial foreclosure is a real action. Venue is where the property is located (Quezon City). Jurisdiction is with the RTC as the assessed value of the real property (Php 500,000) exceeds Php 50,000 (BP 129). (See Q&A No. 1)"
        },
        {
            question: "2. A sheriff attempted to serve summons on Kobe at a Makati hotel. After failing to serve him personally, the sheriff left the summons with the hotel's chief security officer. Was there a valid substituted service?",
            options: [
                "Yes, because the sheriff made several attempts to serve the summons personally.",
                "Yes, because the chief security officer is a person of suitable age and discretion at the defendant's temporary residence.",
                "No, because substituted service on a chief security officer is only valid in a homeowners' community or condominium, not a hotel.",
                "No, because the sheriff should have resorted to service by publication immediately."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: Sec. 6(c), Rule 14 allows substituted service on a chief security officer of a homeowners' community or condominium building where the defendant is found. This does not extend to a hotel's security officer. Furthermore, the defendant had already checked out. (See Q&A No. 2)"
        },
        {
            question: "3. Ten days after service of summons, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss based on improper service of summons. As the judge, how should you rule on the motion?",
            options: [
                "Grant the motion, as lack of jurisdiction over the person is a valid ground.",
                "Deny the motion, because a motion to dismiss on this ground is a prohibited motion.",
                "Treat the motion as an Answer and proceed to trial.",
                "Order the plaintiff to re-serve the summons correctly."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: Under Sec. 12(a), Rule 15, a motion to dismiss is a prohibited motion, except for four grounds: lack of subject matter jurisdiction, res judicata, lis pendens, or prescription. Improper service of summons is not one of the exceptions. (See Q&A No. 3)"
        },
        {
            question: "4. A lawyer served a motion for reconsideration via an accredited courier. The opposing counsel moved to deny it for lacking a written explanation for non-personal service. Is the opposing counsel's argument correct?",
            options: [
                "Yes, all pleadings must prioritize personal service and explain why it was not done.",
                "No, the 2019 Rules of Civil Procedure deleted the requirement for a written explanation for non-personal service.",
                "Yes, because service by courier is the last resort and must be justified.",
                "No, but only if the courier provides a sworn affidavit of service."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: The 2019 amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure removed the requirement for a written explanation when a pleading or motion is not served personally. (See Q&A No. 4a)"
        },
        {
            question: "5. What constitutes proof of service for a motion served via an accredited courier?",
            options: [
                "The courier's official receipt only.",
                "An affidavit of the person who delivered it to the courier and the courier's official receipt or tracking number.",
                "A certification from the courier company that the document was delivered.",
                "The tracking history printed from the courier's website."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: Sec. 17(c), Rule 13 requires an affidavit of service from the person who brought the document to the courier, along with the official receipt or document tracking number provided by the courier. (See Q&A No. 4b)"
        },
        {
            question: "6. Jimuel first sued for nullity of marriage based on psychological incapacity, which was denied. He later filed another petition for nullity based on the absence of a marriage license. The court dismissed the second petition on the ground of res judicata. Was the dismissal proper?",
            options: [
                "No, because the causes of action (psychological incapacity vs. lack of license) are different.",
                "No, because res judicata does not apply to nullity of marriage cases.",
                "Yes, under the concept of conclusiveness of judgment, as the issue of the marriage's validity was already settled.",
                "Yes, under the concept of bar by prior judgment, as the ground of lack of license could have been raised in the first action."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 3,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: This is an application of res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment. A judgment is conclusive not only on matters directly adjudged but also on any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto. The lack of a marriage license could have been raised in the first petition. (Mallion v. Alcantara; See Q&A No. 5)"
        },
        {
            question: "7. A resident filed an action to enjoin a company's kitchen operations and revoke its business permit, praying for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction (WPI). The company filed a verified answer opposing the WPI. Can the court issue the WPI at this stage?",
            options: [
                "Yes, because the verified answer shows that the issues have been joined.",
                "Yes, if the complaint is verified and shows a clear right to the relief demanded.",
                "No, because a preliminary injunction cannot be issued without a hearing.",
                "No, because the potential financial damage to the company outweighs the resident's claims."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: Section 5, Rule 58 explicitly states that no preliminary injunction shall be granted without a hearing. Even with a verified answer filed, a hearing is a mandatory prerequisite. (See Q&A No. 6)"
        },
        {
            question: "8. Is a separate special proceeding to establish one's status as a legal heir a prerequisite to filing an ordinary civil action to enforce ownership rights?",
            options: [
                "Yes, heirship must first be declared in a special proceeding before an heir can sue to protect property.",
                "No, because the rights to succession are transmitted from the moment of the decedent's death under Art. 777 of the Civil Code.",
                "Yes, unless the parties unanimously agree on the partition and distribution.",
                "No, but only if the decedent left no will and no debts."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: A prior determination of heirship in a separate special proceeding is not a prerequisite. The Supreme Court held in Treyes v. Larlar that pursuant to Art. 777 of the Civil Code, heirs can immediately file an action to protect their rights without a separate declaration of heirship. (See Q&A No. 7)"
        },
        {
            question: "9. A Filipina, married in Makati, obtained a divorce by mutual agreement in South Korea. She filed a petition for recognition of the foreign divorce decree in the RTC of Cebu, her place of residence. The OSG argued the proper remedy is a Rule 108 petition filed in Makati. Is the OSG correct?",
            options: [
                "Yes, Rule 108 is the exclusive remedy and venue is where the marriage was recorded.",
                "No, a petition for recognition of a foreign divorce decree is a proper remedy, and it can be filed independently of a Rule 108 petition.",
                "Yes, because the divorce was by mutual agreement, which is against public policy.",
                "No, the proper remedy is a declaratory relief, not a petition for recognition."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: A petition for recognition of a foreign divorce decree is a proper remedy. While it may be done in a Rule 108 proceeding, the Supreme Court did not prohibit filing it as a separate and independent action. (Corpuz v. Sto. Tomas; See Q&A No. 8)"
        },
        {
            question: "10. In a forcible entry case, the MTC ruled against ten defendants. They appealed but failed to file a supersedeas bond. The sheriff, implementing the writ of execution, found the land occupied by lessees of the defendants. Can the sheriff enforce the writ against these lessees?",
            options: [
                "No, because the lessees were not parties to the forcible entry case.",
                "No, the sheriff must first file a separate ejectment case against the lessees.",
                "Yes, because a judgment in an ejectment case is enforceable against the defendant and their privies, including lessees.",
                "Yes, but only after the lessees are given 30 days' notice to vacate."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: A judgment in an ejectment case is binding not only on the defendants but also on their privies, which includes sublessees, co-lessees, and members of their family or employees. The lessees' right to possess is derived from the defendants. (See Q&A No. 9)"
        },
        {
            question: "11. An Information for Murder alleged that the accused, 'with intent to kill and with treachery and abuse of superior strength,' attacked the victim. The accused moved to quash, arguing the Information does not conform to the prescribed form. Is the accused correct?",
            options: [
                "No, the allegation of 'treachery' is sufficient to inform the accused of the charge.",
                "No, the specific acts are matters of evidence to be presented during trial.",
                "Yes, because the Information failed to specify the acts constituting treachery.",
                "Yes, because the Information should have been for Homicide, as treachery was not detailed."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: The Supreme Court has held that an Information must specifically allege the facts and circumstances constituting treachery. Merely stating the word 'treachery' is insufficient and makes the Information non-compliant with the prescribed form. (People v. Solar; See Q&A No. 10)"
        },
        {
            question: "12. Cain pleaded guilty to Murder, a capital offense. The RTC accepted the plea but the prosecution failed to present any evidence. The RTC convicted Cain based solely on his plea of guilt. Was the conviction proper?",
            options: [
                "Yes, a plea of guilt is a judicial admission of all material facts alleged in the Information.",
                "Yes, because the judge was convinced the plea was made voluntarily.",
                "No, because in capital offenses, the court must still require the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt and the precise degree of culpability.",
                "No, because a plea of guilt to a capital offense must be made with the assistance of two counsels."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: Section 3, Rule 116 mandates that when an accused pleads guilty to a capital offense, the court must require the prosecution to prove guilt and the precise degree of culpability. A conviction cannot be based solely on the plea. (See Q&A No. 11)"
        },
        {
            question: "13. Which of the following is an order authorizing law enforcement to listen to, record, or monitor the content of communications as they are occurring?",

                "Warrant to Intercept Computer Data (WICD)",
                "Warrant to Search, Seize and Examine Computer Data (WSSECD)",
                "Warrant of Cyber-Surveillance"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: A Warrant to Intercept Computer Data (WICD) is the specific warrant under the Rule on Cybercrime Warrants that authorizes the real-time surveillance of communications content. (See Q&A No. 12)"
        },
        {
            question: "14. Ricky, in a car accident, offered to pay for the damages to Dante's car. Dante filed a criminal case for Reckless Imprudence and sought to introduce the offer as an admission of guilt. Ricky's counsel objected. How should the judge rule?",
            options: [
                "Overrule the objection, as an offer of compromise is an implied admission of guilt in criminal cases.",
                "Sustain the objection, because an offer of compromise in cases involving quasi-offenses is not admissible as an admission of guilt.",
                "Overrule the objection, as it is part of the res gestae.",
                "Sustain the objection, but only if the offer was made during pre-trial."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: Section 28, Rule 130 provides that an offer of compromise is not an admission of guilt in quasi-offenses (criminal negligence) or those allowed by law to be compromised. Reckless Imprudence is a quasi-offense. (See Q&A No. 13)"
        },
        {
            question: "15. Vanya testified about CCTV footage she transferred from a barangay-owned CCTV to a flash drive. The defense objected to the footage's admissibility because Vanya was not the one who recorded it. Is the footage admissible?",
            options: [
                "No, only the person who recorded the video can authenticate it.",
                "No, the original CCTV hard drive must be presented in court under the Original Document Rule.",
                "Yes, because video evidence can be authenticated by the recorder or by any other person competent to testify on its accuracy.",
                "Yes, because CCTV footage is public record and does not require authentication."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: Sec. 1, Rule 11 of the Rules on Electronic Evidence allows video to be authenticated not just by the recorder, but also by 'some other person competent to testify on the accuracy thereof.' As the person who transferred the footage and witnessed the events, Vanya is competent to testify on its accuracy. (See Q&A No. 14)"
        },
        {
            question: "16. In an Estafa case, the prosecution offered a photocopy of an acknowledgment receipt. The accused objected based on the original document rule. The court admitted the photocopy. Did the court err?",

                "Yes, the original document must be produced as it is the best evidence.",
                "Yes, unless the prosecution can prove the original was lost or destroyed.",
                "No, because a photocopy is a duplicate and is admissible to the same extent as an original under the revised rules.",
                "No, because the original document rule does not apply in criminal cases."
            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Legal Basis: The 2019 Rules on Evidence state that a duplicate (like a photocopy) is admissible to the same extent as an original, unless a genuine question is raised as to the original's authenticity or it is unjust to admit the duplicate. (Sec. 4, Rule 130). (See Q&A No. 15)"
