            // PART I BASED QUESTIONS
            {
                question: "Amado, convicted of Rape and later granted an absolute pardon, is subsequently convicted of Homicide. Under the Revised Penal Code, Amado is considered a:",
                options: {
                    a: "Habitual delinquent, because he has a subsequent conviction.",
                    b: "Recidivist, because both crimes are embraced under the same title of the RPC and the pardon does not erase the conviction.",
                    c: "Quasi-recidivist, because he committed another crime after his first conviction.",
                    d: "Not a recidivist, because the absolute pardon erased all effects of his prior conviction."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: An absolute pardon only erases the service of the sentence, not the fact of the conviction. Since Rape and Homicide are both under Title 8 (Crimes Against Persons) of the RPC, the subsequent conviction makes him a recidivist."
            },
            {
                question: "What is the primary legal effect of an absolute pardon on a convict's criminal record for purposes of determining recidivism?",
                options: {
                    a: "It completely obliterates the crime and its effects, as if no crime was committed.",
                    b: "It only extinguishes the criminal liability but not the fact of conviction.",
                    c: "It restores the convict's civil and political rights, thereby nullifying the prior conviction.",
                    d: "It serves as a mitigating circumstance in case of a subsequent offense."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Jurisprudence holds that an absolute pardon does not erase the conviction itself. The conviction remains a part of the person's record and can be considered for determining recidivism if the subsequent crime falls under the same title of the RPC."
            },
            {
                question: "A creditor forces a child to work for him to pay off the debt of the child's father. What crime is committed?",
                options: {
                    a: "Slavery under the RPC.",
                    b: "Violation of the Anti-Trafficking of Persons Act (R.A. 9208).",
                    c: "Child abuse under R.A. 7610.",
                    d: "Grave Coercion."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: The act constitutes trafficking as defined in R.A. 9208. The purpose is exploitation through forced labor or services, which is explicitly covered by this special law, not slavery under the RPC."
            },
            {
                question: "The use of an unlicensed firearm in the commission of Homicide is considered a:",
                options: {
                    a: "Generic aggravating circumstance that can be offset.",
                    b: "Qualifying circumstance, elevating the crime to Murder.",
                    c: "Special aggravating circumstance where the penalty is imposed in its maximum period.",
                    d: "Separate crime of Illegal Possession of Firearms."
                },
                answer: "c",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: When an unlicensed firearm is used in crimes like Homicide or Murder, it is treated as a special aggravating circumstance, which mandates the imposition of the penalty in its maximum period and cannot be offset by mitigating circumstances."
            },
            {
                question: "During a robbery, a bystander is accidentally killed by one of the robbers. The robber is liable for:",
                options: {
                    a: "Two separate crimes: Robbery and Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Homicide.",
                    b: "Two separate crimes: Robbery and Homicide.",
                    c: "The special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide.",
                    d: "The crime of Robbery, with the death being a generic aggravating circumstance."
                },
                answer: "c",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: The law provides for the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide. As long as a killing occurs by reason or on the occasion of the robbery, this single, indivisible crime is committed, regardless of who was killed or whether the killing was intentional or accidental."
            },
            {
                question: "A policeman, not authorized by a judicial order, enters a private house against the owner's will. What crime is committed?",
                options: {
                    a: "Trespass to Dwelling.",
                    b: "Violation of Domicile.",
                    c: "Grave Coercion.",
                    d: "Abuse in the exercise of public functions."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Article 128 of the RPC defines Violation of Domicile. Trespass to Dwelling (Art. 280) is committed by a private person, whereas Violation of Domicile is committed by a public officer or employee."
            },
            {
                question: "Antero, convicted of Rebellion, escapes from jail. He is later granted amnesty for the crime of Rebellion. What is the effect of the amnesty on his conviction for Evasion of Service of Sentence?",
                options: {
                    a: "The conviction for Evasion stands because it is a separate crime from Rebellion.",
                    b: "The conviction for Evasion is extinguished because the amnesty obliterated the crime of Rebellion, which was the basis for the sentence being served.",
                    c: "The conviction for Evasion is reduced to a lesser penalty.",
                    d: "The amnesty has no effect, but Antero can apply for a separate pardon for the Evasion charge."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Amnesty completely obliterates the offense and all its legal effects. Since the sentence being evaded stemmed from the crime of Rebellion, which has been erased by amnesty, the legal basis for the Evasion of Service of Sentence conviction disappears."
            },
            {
                question: "Rigoberto hits Judge Lorenzo on the back with a piece of wood. The attack was motivated by a grudge because the Judge had cited Rigoberto for contempt two years earlier. Rigoberto is guilty of:",
                options: {
                    a: "Direct Assault.",
                    b: "Less Serious Physical Injuries only.",
                    c: "Indirect Assault.",
                    d: "Attempted Homicide."
                },
                answer: "a",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Article 148 of the RPC defines Direct Assault. The crime is committed not only when a person in authority is attacked while engaged in official duties, but also when the attack is by reason of the past performance of such duties."
            },
            {
                question: "Charlie, intending to poison Brad, obtains a substance from a veterinarian which he mixes into Brad's food. The substance turns out to be a harmless, non-toxic powder. What crime did Charlie commit?",
                options: {
                    a: "No crime, because the means used were ineffectual.",
                    b: "Attempted Murder.",
                    c: "Frustrated Murder.",
                    d: "Impossible Crime of Murder."
                },
                answer: "d",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Article 4, par. 2 of the RPC. The act would have been a crime against persons (Murder) but was not accomplished due to the employment of ineffectual means, which is a classic case of an impossible crime."
            },
            {
                question: "Following the previous scenario, what if the harmless powder caused Brad to have a severe allergic reaction, requiring 10 days of hospitalization? What is Charlie's liability?",
                options: {
                    a: "Still an Impossible Crime of Murder.",
                    b: "Less Serious Physical Injuries.",
                    c: "Serious Physical Injuries.",
                    d: "Attempted Murder through reckless imprudence."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: When the act performed, intended as an impossible crime, results in another offense punishable under the RPC, the offender is liable for that other offense. Hospitalization of 10 days falls under Less Serious Physical Injuries."
            },
            {
                question: "Ruben lends Ponciano his gun, knowing Ponciano intends to kill Freddie with it. Ponciano later kills Freddie but uses a knife instead. What is Ruben's criminal liability?",
                options: {
                    a: "Principal by inducement for Murder.",
                    b: "Accomplice to Murder.",
                    c: "Accessory to Murder.",
                    d: "No criminal liability."
                },
                answer: "d",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Ruben's act of lending the gun is in the preparatory stage. There is no conspiracy as there was no agreement on the commission of the crime, and he did not directly participate. Mere knowledge without participation does not create criminal liability."
            },
            {
                question: "Baldo secretly killed Conrad in 1960. A witness, Dominador, only reported the crime to the police in 1970 due to fear. Baldo was arrested in 1980. When did the 20-year prescriptive period for Murder begin to run?",
                options: {
                    a: "In 1960, the day the crime was committed.",
                    b: "In 1980, the day the perpetrator was arrested.",
                    c: "In 1970, the day the crime was discovered by the authorities.",
                    d: "The crime of Murder does not prescribe."
                },
                answer: "c",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Article 91 of the RPC states that for crimes not known at the time of commission, the prescriptive period commences from the day of discovery by the offended party, the authorities, or their agents."
            },
            {
                question: "Charina, a Clerk of Court, accepted P20,000 to convince a judge to rule in a plaintiff's favor. She was charged under R.A. 3019 and later, for Indirect Bribery under the RPC. Charina claims double jeopardy. Is her claim correct?",
                options: {
                    a: "Yes, because both charges arise from the same act.",
                    b: "No, because the elements of the violation of R.A. 3019 and Indirect Bribery under the RPC are different.",
                    c: "Yes, because R.A. 3019 is the more specific law and should prevail.",
                    d: "No, because double jeopardy only applies if the first case was already resolved."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: For double jeopardy to apply, the elements of both offenses must be the same. The elements for violating Sec. 3(b) of R.A. 3019 are distinct from the elements of Indirect Bribery under Art. 211 of the RPC, thus allowing for separate prosecutions."
            },
            {
                question: "During a bank robbery, a policeman responding to the scene is killed in a shootout with the robbers. The robbers are liable for:",
                options: {
                    a: "Robbery and a separate crime of Homicide.",

                    c: "The special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide.",
                    d: "Robbery, with the policeman's death considered as a quasi-recidivism."
                },
                answer: "c",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: The special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide is committed whenever a killing results by reason or on the occasion of the robbery. This applies regardless of who is killed, including responding authorities."
            },
            {
                question: "Virgilio stops a van, orders the driver out, and tells him to inform the parents of the 6-year-old child inside that a ransom of P10-million is needed, otherwise the child would be beheaded. He keeps the child and the nanny. What crime did Virgilio commit?",

                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Article 267 of the RPC defines Kidnapping. The act of detaining a person for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person constitutes the qualifying circumstance for Kidnapping for Ransom, which carries the highest penalty."
            },
            {

                    a: "Delivery of Prisoners from Jail, Corruption of Public Officials, and Falsification of Public Document as principal by inducement.",
                    b: "Only for Corruption of Public Officials, as the other acts were done by the Clerk.",
                    c: "Only as an accomplice to Evasion of Service of Sentence.",

                },
                answer: "a",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Chito is liable as a principal by inducement for the Falsification (Art. 172), for Corruption of Public Officials for the bribe (Art. 212), and for Delivery of Prisoners from Jail for aiding the escape (Art. 156)."
            },
            {
                question: "Vincent, a convict serving a final sentence, escapes with the help of Chito's scheme. What crime did Vincent commit?",

                },
                answer: "b",

            // PART II BASED QUESTIONS

                    c: "Reclusion Perpetua is more favorable because it has a fixed duration of 20 years and 1 day to 40 years, while Life Imprisonment does not.",
                    d: "Reclusion Perpetua is imposed for crimes under special laws, while Life Imprisonment is for crimes under the RPC."
                },
                answer: "c",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Reclusion Perpetua, a penalty under the RPC, has a defined range and is subject to the rules on modifying circumstances. Life Imprisonment, typically imposed by special laws, does not have a fixed duration and is not subject to the same rules, making it less favorable."

                question: "Is voluntary surrender a mitigating circumstance in all crimes under the Revised Penal Code?",

                    a: "Yes, it is a universal mitigating circumstance.",
                    b: "No, it does not apply to crimes committed through culpa (negligence).",
                    c: "Yes, unless the offender is a recidivist.",
                    d: "No, it only applies to crimes against persons."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: Under Article 365 (Criminal Negligence), the court has discretion in imposing penalties and is not bound by the rules in Article 64 regarding mitigating circumstances. Therefore, voluntary surrender may be disregarded in such cases."
            },

                    a: "Yes, because intent is a key element of fencing.",

                    c: "Yes, but only if he can present a valid receipt for the goods.",
                    d: "No, because mere possession of stolen goods is conclusive proof of fencing."

                    a: "A judge who refrains from convicting a drug lord.",
                    b: "A police officer who refrains from arresting a murderer.",
                    c: "A BIR examiner who refrains from filing a tax evasion case.",
                    d: "Any public officer who accepts a bribe."
                },
                answer: "b",
                explanation: "LEGAL BASIS: The crime of Qualified Bribery specifically applies to public officers entrusted with law enforcement, such as police officers and prosecutors. A judge's function is adjudication, not law enforcement in this context."

                options: {
                    a: "Yes, because he had sexual intercourse with a woman who is not his wife.",
                    b: "No, because Concubinage requires either keeping a mistress in the conjugal dwelling, cohabiting with her elsewhere, or having sexual intercourse under scandalous circumstances.",
                    c: "Yes, because any act of marital infidelity by the husband is concubinage.",
                    d: "No, because the act was done in a private hotel room."
                },
                answer: "b",
