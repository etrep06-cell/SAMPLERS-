                question: "1. Under the Intellectual Property Code, which test for patent infringement applies when a device incorporates an invention's innovative concept but with minor modifications, performing substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result?",
                options: [
                    "Literal Infringement Test",
                    "Doctrine of Equivalents",
                    "Fair Use Doctrine",
                    "Novelty and Inventive Step Test"
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: The Doctrine of Equivalents, also known as the 'function-means-and-result test', dictates that infringement occurs when a device or process appropriates a prior invention by incorporating its innovative concept and, even with some modification, performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result."
            },
            {
                question: "2. A company develops a manufacturing process that is identical to a patented process, except for a minor, non-essential alteration that does not change the core function or result. What is the most likely outcome of an infringement suit?",
                options: [
                    "No infringement, as the processes are not exactly identical.",
                    "Infringement under the Literal Infringement Test.",
                    "Infringement under the Doctrine of Equivalents.",
                    "No infringement, as minor improvements are not patentable."
                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: The Doctrine of Equivalents applies precisely in such situations. While the minor alteration may defeat a claim of literal infringement, liability can still attach if the modified process performs substantially the same function in the same way for the same result."
            },
            {
                question: "3. In the context of patent law, literal infringement occurs when:",
                options: [
                    "The infringing product is functionally similar to the patented product.",
                    "The infringing item contains some, but not all, of the elements of the patent claim.",
                    "An item contains all the elements of a patent claim.",
                    "The infringing product was created with knowledge of the existing patent."
                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: Literal infringement requires that the accused device or process embodies every single element of a patent claim. The absence of even one element can preclude a finding of literal infringement."
            },
            {
                question: "4. A key defense against literal infringement is that the accused product has a 'minor modification'. How does this defense interact with the Doctrine of Equivalents?",
                options: [
                    "It is a complete defense to any infringement claim.",
                    "It defeats literal infringement but may still be liable under the Doctrine of Equivalents.",
                    "It is irrelevant to both tests of infringement.",
                    "It shifts the burden of proof to the patent holder to prove substantial similarity."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: A minor modification may be sufficient to place an item beyond the scope of literal infringement. However, this very modification is what triggers the application of the Doctrine of Equivalents to determine if the innovative concept was still appropriated."
            },
             {
                question: "5. XYZ Corp. patented a process for making coffee using beans roasted at exactly 150°C. ABC Corp. makes coffee using the same process but roasts the beans at 155°C, achieving the same quality and taste. XYZ Corp. sues for infringement. What is its strongest argument?",
                options: [
                    "That ABC's process is a literal infringement of the patent.",
                    "That ABC's 5°C difference is an insubstantial change and the processes are equivalent.",
                    "That any use of a similar roasting process constitutes unfair competition.",
                    "That ABC's process lacks the novelty required to avoid infringement."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: XYZ Corp's strongest argument is under the Doctrine of Equivalents. The change in temperature is a modification, but if it performs the same function (roasting beans) in substantially the same way (thermal process) to achieve the same result (quality coffee), it constitutes infringement."
            },
            {
                question: "6. The 'function-means-and-result test' is primarily associated with which legal principle?",
                options: [
                    "Patentability requirements under the IPC.",
                    "The test for copyright originality.",
                    "The Doctrine of Equivalents in patent law.",
                    "The test for trademark distinctiveness."
                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: The 'function-means-and-result test' is the standard used to apply the Doctrine of Equivalents. It assesses whether a modified device or process performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result as the patented invention."
            },
             {
                question: "7. When can a defendant in a patent infringement case successfully argue that their process, while similar, is not an infringement?",
                options: [
                    "When they can prove they were unaware of the patent.",
                    "When their process involves a minor improvement over the patented one.",
                    "When their process does not contain all elements of the patent claim and is not substantially equivalent.",
                    "When their product is sold at a lower price than the patentee's."
                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: To avoid liability, a defendant must show their process falls outside both tests: it does not literally infringe (lacks one or more patent elements) AND it does not infringe under the Doctrine of Equivalents (it performs a different function, or in a different way, or for a different result)."

            {
                question: "8. How is the nationality of a corporation sole determined for the purpose of land acquisition in the Philippines?",
                options: [
                    "By the nationality of its chief presiding elder.",
                    "By the country where it was first established.",
                    "By the nationality of the members constituting the religious sect in the Philippines.",
                    "A corporation sole is considered stateless and cannot own land."
                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: For purposes of applying national laws on land acquisition, the nationality of a corporation sole is determined not by its presiding elder, but by the nationality of its members. Jurisprudence (Roman Catholic v. LRC) confirms this principle."
            },
            {
                question: "9. A corporation sole, whose members are 100% Filipino citizens but is headed by a Canadian bishop, wishes to purchase a parcel of land. Is this transaction valid?",
                options: [
                    "No, because the head of the corporation is a foreigner.",
                    "Yes, because at least 60% of its members are Filipinos.",
                    "No, because religious corporations are prohibited from owning land.",
                    "Yes, provided the land is used exclusively for religious purposes."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: The transaction is valid. The law requires that for a corporation sole to acquire land, at least 60% of its members must be Filipinos. The nationality of the presiding elder is immaterial for this purpose."
            },
            {
                question: "10. What is the primary purpose of a corporation sole under the Revised Corporation Code?",

                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: Section 106 of the Revised Corporation Code defines a corporation sole as one formed by a presiding elder for the purpose of administering and managing, as trustee, the affairs, property, and temporalities of any religious denomination, sect, or church."
            },
             {
                question: "11. Based on prevailing jurisprudence, the rule that a corporation sole's capacity to own land depends on its members' nationality is intended to:",

                    "Prevent foreign control of religious organizations.",
                    "Uphold the constitutional prohibition on foreign ownership of land.",
                    "Harmonize the Corporation Code with Canon Law.",
                    "Limit the properties that a religious sect can acquire."
                ],
                answer: 1,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: This rule respects the constitutional limitation on land ownership by aliens while allowing bona fide religious organizations, composed predominantly of Filipinos, to own property for their needs, irrespective of the nationality of their current leader."

                    "No, because it fails to meet the 60% Filipino membership requirement.",

                ],
                answer: 2,
                explanation: "Legal Basis: The corporation sole cannot acquire land by purchase because it does not satisfy the 'at least 60% Filipino membership' requirement for purposes of land acquisition."

                answer: 2,

                explanation: "Legal Basis: The Electronic Commerce Act provides that an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed in electronic data messages. A clear message of acceptance perfects the contract, as it is a meeting of the minds facilitated by electronic means."
